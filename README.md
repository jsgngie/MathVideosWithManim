The repository contains code for four videos: [*Mis asi see kolmnurk on?*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJfxr4mdaoA), [*Mis asi see ring on?*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b81bB1ln2Q), [*Mis asi see ristkülik on?*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_adtHPSXHhk) and [*Mis asi see ruut on?*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvxci001zgM), which were created as the practical portion of the bachelor thesis, Manimi abil loodud õppevideod põhikooli matemaatikast. The code is contained in folders: *triangle*, *circle*, *rectangle* and *square* respectively.

The aim of these videos is to give another way for children in primary school to learn maths, using the Manim python library to create animations with visuals to support this aim.

In addition it contains the code, which was used to generate the thumbnails for said videos and an example Manim animation program, which was used in the theoretical part of the thesis. This code can be found in the folder *thumbnails*.

For instructions on how to generate animations given this code, please refer to the Manim Community Edition [documentation](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/).

Huge thanks to the Manim community for creating such an amazing tool that allows educators, aspiring and practicing alike, to create better and more attention capturing materials.
